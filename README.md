## How It's Made:

### Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### To develop this horoscope I used a simple combination of HTML & CSS paired with a large conditional statement for the JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

After discussing with peers about how they tackled the challenge of building a horoscope I realized there were more efficient ways of doing it. I would like to try to use different methods in the future, possible by building an object and pulling the data needed as properties.
